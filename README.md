- Spring Boot framework.
- Maven build system.
- H2 in-memory database (default) for development.
- Docker support.

- **Java 21** or higher
- **Maven 3.8.8+**
- **Docker** (optional, for containerization)

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                   |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/v1/books`      | Retrieve all books            |
| GET    | `/api/v1/books/{id}` | Retrieve a specific book      |
| POST   | `/api/v1/books`      | Create a new book             |
| PUT    | `/api/v1/books/{id}` | Update an existing book       |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/books/{id}` | Delete a book                 |

## Database

By default, the project uses an in-memory H2 database for local development. You can access the H2 console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` (username: `sa`, password: empty).

To configure a persistent database, update the `application.properties` file with your preferred database settings.

## Testing

To run the unit and integration tests, use the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```
